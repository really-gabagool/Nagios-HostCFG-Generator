How to use this to generate basic host config files for Nagios...

Save the create.ps1 and template.txt files to a directory. Within that directory, create another directory called "nagios_cfg".

Open the powershell script and make sure the paths listed match the paths of your environment

Change <NAGIOS-IP> the to the IP of your server to allow the script to automatically upload the CFG to the HOSTS directory.

I'll redo this soon, and maybe make a youtube video.
